Key Improvements
Simplified Relationship Management

Merged Friend + Relationship into contacts, adding relationship_tier and last_interacted_at (aligns with Dunbar’s Number visualization).

Removed standalone Relationship table to reduce complexity.

AI Integration

Added ai_prompts to track AI-generated nudges and conversation starters (critical for MVP’s proactive value).

Modernized Scheduling

Replaced Availability → calendar_events with viral shareable_link.

Replaced OptIn → rsvps to handle cross-user scheduling (e.g., friends RSVP’ing via shared links).

Real-Time Chat

Split generic Interaction into messages (real-time chat) and interactions (meetups/calls), improving focus.

Monetization Ready

Added subscriptions to enforce freemium limits (50 contacts for Free, 150 for Premium).

Why This Works
Comprehensive: Covers all MVP features (Dunbar visualization, AI nudges, scheduling, chat, monetization).

Concise: Eliminates redundancy (e.g., merging Friend + Relationship).

Scalable: Supports future phases (e.g., content_clips table can be added later for Phase 2).
